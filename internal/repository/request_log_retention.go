// Package repository provides the request-log rolling retention: the pure
// deletion predicate and the bounded single-round sweep the background
// retention loop drives. The retention window itself (days, 0 = keep
// forever) is the request-log-retention system setting; this file owns
// what "expired" means and how one round removes an expired row's whole
// audit triple — the request_logs row, its request_log_bodies row, and the
// stream capture file under the bodies directory.

// DefaultRequestLogRetentionBatchLimit caps how many expired request_logs

// one unbounded DELETE that would pin the audit table (and its writer, the
// gateway's live request path) while years of backlog drain; rounds simply
// repeat, so any backlog converges over time. Named constant with an
// injected override: callers pass their own limit, and a zero or negative
// limit falls back to this default.

// (which the write side's 0..3650 domain cannot produce — only a corrupt
// row could) also keeps forever: a nonsensical setting must fail toward

// older than now − retentionDays×24h (oldest first), each selected row's
// request_log_bodies row in the same transaction, and each row's stream
// capture file (bodiesDir/<request_id>.stream) right after the commit.

// retentionDays <= 0 removes nothing (keep forever — the same guard the
// predicate applies, enforced here again so the query itself can never run
// with a window that would match every row). batchLimit <= 0 falls back to
// DefaultRequestLogRetentionBatchLimit. Rounds are idempotent and meant to
// be repeated by the background loop until one returns 0; shrinking the
// retention creates a backlog that drains over several rounds, never in
// one synchronous purge.
//
// Stream files are removed strictly best-effort AFTER the database rows
// commit. A file that is already gone is the expected case (non-stream
// rows never had one); any other removal error is ignored and the file is
// left behind as an orphan — reclaiming crash-window orphans is
// deliberately out of scope, because the opposite order (file first, rows
// after) would leave committed body rows pointing at deleted files
// whenever the transaction fails. An empty bodiesDir skips the file pass
// entirely — unresolved directory, the same convention the gateway's
// stream capture uses — rather than unlinking paths relative to the
