// Package retention runs the background loop that enforces the request-log
// rolling-retention setting: every heartbeat it re-reads the retention
// snapshot and, when a positive window is configured, drives one bounded
// sweep of the deletion engine in internal/repository — the expired
// request_logs rows, their request_log_bodies rows, and their stream
// capture files leave together, capped per round so a backlog drains
// gradually over successive rounds without one unbounded transaction ever
// pinning the audit tables.
//
// The loop owns ONLY the schedule: when a round happens and which setting
// value it acts on. What "expired" means and how one round removes a row's
// whole audit triple is entirely the sweep engine's; nothing here
// re-implements any of it.
